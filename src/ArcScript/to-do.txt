Magisters Terrace:

*Kael'thas:
-Fly Phase.
-Spawn and cast of his Phoenix.



*Priestess Dellrissa:
she random spawns 4 of 8 Minions(before on_combat)
-> Find a solution for that problem. (Maybe do an On_Spawn function in lua that randomly generates which creatures go with her, so each time a seperate raid enters the instance, 4 different bosses will be there?)
