Place compiled vmap_extractor.exe, vmap_assembler.exe, splitConfig.txt, and collision_assembly.bat in world of warcraft folder.
Also make sure you have your maps in world of warcraft folder too or it will fail.

Run collision_assembly.bat. Please be patient this can last for 1-2 hours depending on your machine.

After assembly is completed move vmaps folder in your ArcEmu server folder and enable Collision in your arcemu-world.conf

Congrats. You are now done.
