As before, everyone is free to work on what they wish, but working on high priority helps us reach milestones faster, and yes, were going to work by those from now on.

[OT] Normal WoW Scripts: Finish off everything in retail WoW, instances, quests, bosses.

[OT] LUA Scripts:
>All scripts in Archieved Scripts/GM Scripts/ need to be rewritten in LUA.

[IN] AQ 20/40

[QST] All Class Quests.
>Class Quests still in GM scripts, need to be rewritten in LUA.



[IN] Sunwell:
-[NPC] Keal'thas

-[NPC] Priestess Delrissa:
She random spawns 4 of 8 Minions(before on_combat).
>Find a solution for that problem. (Maybe do an On_Spawn function in lua that randomly
generates which creatures go with her, so each time a seperate raid enters the instance,
4 different bosses will be there?


[IN] Kharazan

-[OT] Chess Event
-[NPC] Still a few bugs with bosses, like Attumen the Huntsman.
