Step forward! When fulfilling the sacrifice:    * Yogg-Saron, grant me your power!    * Master, a gift for you! When preaching:    * The elements themselves will rise up against the civilized world! Only the faithful will be spared!    * Immortality can be yours. But only if you pledge yourself fully to Yogg-Saron!    * Here on the very borders of his domain. You will experience powers you would never have imagined!    * You have traveled long and risked much to be here. Your devotion shall be rewarded.    * The faithful shall be exalted! But there is more work to be done. We will press on until all of Azeroth lies beneath his shadow! ]]function Jedoga_OnCombat(pUnit, Event)	--pUnit:PlaySoundToSet()	pUnit:SendChatMessage(12, 0, "These are sacred halls!
