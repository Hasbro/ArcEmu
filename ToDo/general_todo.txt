==========================================================================
! BUGS !
- creatures keep yelling no content messgs
- some teleportation spells have target_type 17 and they will not generate a target to be teleported. Right now there is a special if for this in spell.cpp (ugly)
- Pets - You can attack players from your faction with pets
- starfire stuns the caster instead of target.
- "if I have a mob or player dotted when I use fear on them, it causes me to become feared when the dot ticks. This one really pwns warlocks, priests and even warriors."
- "you can have 2 water elementals"
- you gain combo point even on spell failed (backstab)
- you should gain mining skill if the bar has been filled instead on cast action
- try to use these items : 34349, 34348, 34347, they should not work for some reason
- Reckoning procs on Reckoning since it uses extra attacks that do not inherit any variables about their state
- mob casted aoe spells gather no targets. use blizzard for example
- grounding totem should magnet bad spells. This mean if owner takes damage it might destroy totem. Also make it cast spell every 10 sec or so
- inspecting will not show talents correctly
- will of forsaken should work for sleep and charm too ?
- cannibalize should be cheked for targets and animation is only for caster.
- readd earth shield to spellindex and make spellindex support stacking
- some spells are procing spell id = 1. Why and who ?
- socketing thrown weapons makes server crash
- charge and intercept needs to retarget the mob in order to attack it again
- eventtable might hold pointers to objects that were dealocated before event ocured = crash
- reloadtable not working ?
- with guid hacking make sure to not target frendly / enemy npc when not supposed to
- fix exploit trading soulbound items
- crash recovery should make sure to cleanup eventmanager of pointers forcedly deleted.
- streangth totem and instances exploit exists at all ?
- player in stealth must become visible when he start using bg flag or control point
- if started bg have not enough players bg'll finished in 5 minutes all players recive 2marks
- focused fire and Spirit Bond reamins on caster after pet is dismissed : SPELL_FLAG_IS_EXPIREING_WITH_PET
- pets do not work with collision enabled
- sockets for thrown weapons disabled - was causing server crash - fix in item.cpp itemhandler.cpp
- exploit to increase player count in instance to X amount.
- pets summoned in instances crash the server

==========================================================================
player A must have any unsoulbound bag and he must party with player B ..
after party player A must add that bag at Container slot 2.. (bag must empty)

Char: Lvl 20 Warlock
Mobs: Stonesplinter Bonesnapper f.e. http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=1164
Used Spells:
Fear, http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=5782
Corruption, http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=6222
Curse of Agony http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=1014
If you attack the Mob and use Corruption and Curse of Agony it happens sometimes that they will regen HP ONCE directly AFTER the debuff runs out. If you use fear on them, they will regenerate about 10% of life each tick.
Easy to reproduce.
You will only see this on low lvl mobs I bet high level regen the same but due the more dmg dealt to them in higher levels this won't really noticed.
