bug: Force of Nature, only spawns trees when you cast over an enemy faction. If are more than one enemy into the target area, will be X * 3 trees, where X is the number of enemies into the target area. Don't attack the enemy if he's passive enemy (Yellow Enemies) or your duel's enemy.
How it should work: Should spawn the trees event if you don't have a target. Should spawn only 3 trees . Should attack any enemy who is on combat with the caster event if they are passive, or etc...
