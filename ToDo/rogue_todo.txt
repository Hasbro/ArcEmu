So the 1st. problem wich is the biggest problem is that Mutilate doesnt get 50% bonus dmg vs. poisoned targets.
The 2nd. VERY importanta bug is that Lethality doesn't effect Mutilate's critical hits.
3rd. The icon dmg of Mutilate ( which is around 100 and something ) doesnt effect by Opportunity.With opportunity it must be 120+ )

Check the WoWWiKi.com formulas. http://www.wowwiki.com/Mutilate
http://www.wowwiki.com/Lethality
http://www.wowwiki.com/Opportunity

/////
Opportunity = 1 + (0.04 * Opportunity Rank)
Offhand Reduction = 0.5 + (0.05 * Dual Wield Specialization Rank)
Lethality = 0.06 * Lethality Rank
Poison Bonus = 1 + (0.5 if Poisoned Target)

Average Weapon Damage = (Weapon Minimum Damage + Weapon Maximum Damage) / 2
Modifier = (Attack Power / 14) * 1.7
Base Damage = Average Weapon Damage + Modifier

Mainhand Base Damage = Base Damage + Mutilate Bonus Damage
Mainhand Damage = Mainhand Base Damage * Poison Bonus * Opportunity
Mainhand Critical Damage = Mainhand Damage * (2 + Lethality)

Offhand Base Damage = (Base Damage * Offhand Reduction) + ( Mutilate Bonus Damage * (1 + (.1 * Dual Wield Specialization Rank))
Offhand Damage = Offhand Base Damage * Poison Bonus * Opportunity
Offhand Critical Damage = Offhand Damage * (2 + Lethality)

Minimum Mutilate Damage = Mainhand Damage + Offhand Damage
Maximum Mutilate Damage = Mainhand Critical Damage + Offhand Critical Damage
