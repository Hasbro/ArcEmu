This is Blizzard's WoW Launcher site. It is what you see whenever you start up the launcher. It's directly ripped from launcher.worldofwarcraft.com and also includes 21 thumbs and 60 backgrounds. 


This will be updated pretty much whenever Blizzard's updates launcher.worldofwarcraft.com



I will probably create a folder of old views of the site.
