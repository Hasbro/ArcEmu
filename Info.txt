Hello, this is the current directory structure please follow these guidelines.

SCRIPTS

C++: branches/arcscripts/Zone_or_EventName\
Example: branches/arcscripts/Brewfest\

Lua: branches\arcscripts\lua\Zone_or_EventName\
Example: branches\arcscripts\Molten Core\

!Important!

SQL 

Lua: branches\arcscripts\lua/Zone_or_EventName/sql\
C++: branches\arcscripts\zone_or_EventName/sql\

Examples:

Lua: branches\arcscripts\lua\Molten Core\sql\
C++: branches\arcscripts\Brewfest\sql\

This will allow users to select which sql files they would 
like to apply specifically and make it much more organized on both ends.

C++ scripts will eventually be migrated into a project file
which will compile the ones the user wants all together.

Custom scripts

Everyone enjoys a custom fun experience now and again.
We have special folders to include custom scripts in which
you are welcome to place custom scripts.

Lua: branches\arcscripts\lua\Custom\Zone_or_EventName\
C++: branches\arcscripts\custom\Zone_or_EventName\

Examples: 
Lua: branches\arcscripts\lua\Custom\Molten Core Custom
C++: branches\arcscripts\custom\Wonderland Custom\

Please make sure you add to the folder name, Custom to indicate
it's custom as filenames may become confusing.

Thank you for taking the time to read and abide by these guidelines.
Sincerely, the staff.
