bug Avenger's shield:
-Target gets "dazed" from the effect of the avenger's shield and the "daze" has a duration
-Holy shield hits three targets nonregarding how far away they are from each other
-Does not deliver any damage while launcehd: No aggro taken as EMU AI doesn't regodnize "resist" as a threat, which I'm quite sure in retail wow is different
How avenger's shield should work:
-Targets get dazed, check
-Avenger's shield jumps to 3 targets in ~10 to ~20 yard radiouus (can't tell for sure haven't played retail for a while) and disappears after this
-Deals around 400 to 600 holy damage to first target from which when it jumps to additional target it reduces the damage delivered by 10% (This needs a confirmation though, this is how I remeber it from the retail)

bug Divine shield:
-Makes you immune to every offencive ability targeted on you, including melee/range hits and caster spells (not including mass dispel)
-Adds debuff forbearence
-Does not prevent player moving, casting spells. Prevents player to gain any self buffs, such as Light's Grace, any blessings, any seals
-Slow downs attack rate by 100% (0% if you're talented from protection tree; Sacred duty, needs confirmation)
How Divine shield should work
-Makes you immune to anything that would harm you, does not include mass dispel (Wokrs in OA?)
-Adds debuff "forbearence"
-Does not prevent player of moving, casting spells or aquiring own buffs, slows down attack rate by 100% (0% if you're talented from protection tree; Sacred Duty)

bug Hammer of justice
-Target is stunned for $s period of time. During stunned he can't cast any spells than breaking snares (ie blink) or immunity spells (Divine shield), the target while stunned can't cast The Blessing of Protection -spell on anyone else than itself (this is unconfirmed still (BOP))
-Player has to be facing the target in order to stun his target, 10 yard radious
How Hammer of Justice should work
-Target is stunned for $s period of time. During stunned he can't cast any spells than breaking snares (ie blink) or immunity spells (Divine shield), the target while stunned can't cast The Blessing of Protection -spell on anyone else than itself
-Target can be stunned from 10 yard radious and has 360 degrees ability, meaning you don't have to face your target to stun it

bug Divine Favor
-one charge, cooldown starts after the skill is applied, not after it's used (ie on retail when you apply the Divine Favor the cooldown begins when you cast following, holy light, flash of light or holy shock or the cooldown starts when you "dispell" it from your friendly buffs)
How Divine Favor should work
-Increases the change your holy light, flash of light or holy shock will crit by 100%
-one charge, the cooldown starts when skill is used

bug: Talent: Vindication
-Can be casted on every mob found from the world, even on bossess

How Talent: Vindication should work
-Reduces the attributes of player's target by 5,10,15% (3 point talent)
-Can't be casted on bossess nor instance bossess (Ie, Kazzak, Lord Baron)

Revision: 291
bug: Greater blessing of X
-When dismounted the spell can't be casted and gives you an error saying "Spell is not ready yet"
-After this no paladin can cast greater blessings on anyone

Revision: 291
bug: Spiritual Attument - Does not return mana
How it should work returns 11% mana from healing castd on you (ie 1100 fol casted on you you gain, ~100mana (Highly unclear yet)
