1) Your pet suddenly disappears even though he is well fed and happy and there is no way to get him back. This costs a lot of bread.

2) None of the pet training skills work, no matter how many training points you have it always says that you don't have enough points to train that skill.

3) Pet talents, or what ever they are called are not added to your training book.
For example if I have a cat with claw, when I abandon him the skill is not left to train to another pet.

4) The pet command bar sometimes looses the first three commands.
The only way to fix it is to train another pet. My friend lost six pets in two days either by having them vanish or having his pet bar go buggers. My present pet has been with me for 3 days a new record.

5) And last the pet commands that control his temperament "Aggressive, Passive and Defensive", don't really seem to work. In defensive mode he will run around killing everything in site and then stand by and watch when I am attacked.

6) I tried taming a Zehvra Runner and after the channeling bar was done, it just kept attacking me and didn't become a pet.

7) Today, I put my pet in the stable and quit. When I logged back in, it was beside me. I don't know if that's a bug though.

8) Also, in the quest Taming the Beast (http://thottbot.com/q6061), after using the taming rod, the beast becomes your pet (friendly [green]), but continues to attack. I was unable to kill it and had to die 3 times to tame 3 different animals as per the quest.

9) My voidwalker, in some areas like Ambermill in Silverpine Forest, suddenly wont attack anything. Outside of those areas, they are fine, but in them they will not listen to your attack commands.

My Report


Tested this with a 70 hunter and a pet about level 63 outside of shattrath.

Some spells that need to be learned as the hunter trainers do not train them.

[Bug]
After a pets death when a pet is revived. The pet seems real buggy ... Jumps around and is glitchy.

--also noted

If a pet is left dead to long it will disapear. once you revive it the pet wont revive until you call pet first then revive.
Also if this happens your pet bar does not come up again.

Found that if you put your pet on passive the actualy pet will start comming back to u when you recall it but when it gets hit again it will run back to the mob. Although it runs back it wont attack the mob but still should not run back.
