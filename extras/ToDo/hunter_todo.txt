Major Bugs:

Hunters Mark

- Does nothing except look good... makes no inpact on any ranged dmg.
- Meant to add AP on ranged attacks and stacks with each attack.


Auto Shoot (yes its that bad)

- Meant to - Auto attacks ranged weapon... shoots in intervals of attack speed... LOL
- Currently - works fine until you use a ranged attack spell then it just stops auto attacking at times and wont let u attack unless u re-select the target.

Beast Mastery (yes its that bad)

Dont want to be general here but only the basic stat+ bonuses from talents work here..
Thats about 10% of talents working There is literally no interaction between pet / advancement and talents. Beast Mastery and Pets are still way below possibility.
I think a real project needs to be initiated here to actually make some progress on pets and Hunters because they are falling way behind compared to the great work on other classes.

Other known:

Talent: Ranged Weapon Spec
- Increases ranged damage by up to 5%
- Dosent seem to make any difference in tests.

Talent: Improved Hunters Mark
- Gives some AP from Hunters mark for melee dmg
- Hunters Mark does nothing so this dosnet work either.

Trueshot aura
- You cannot use this inside raids / dungeons no idea why.
